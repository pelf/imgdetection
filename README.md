Testing different image hashing methods
=======================================

We need to recognize images we've seen before. These are a bunch of tests to figure out the best speed-accuracy-size compromise.

I tried a bunch of different approaches for the hashing: colored and b&w, average color, brightness, most common colors, etc.
